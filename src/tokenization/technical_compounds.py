"""Technical compound detection for skill classification.

Issue #191 Phase 2: Enhanced technical compound patterns for reclassification.
Identifies compound phrases that should be technologies, not skills.

Technical compounds identified in Phase 3 output:
- "software development" (6x) - development methodology
- "data processing" (3x) - data pipeline work
- "engineering technology" (3x) - tech framework/platform
- "manufacturing engineering" (3x) - engineering specialization
- "system-level" (3x) - architectural design

Confidence thresholds:
- High confidence (80%+): Exact matches, pattern-based detection
- Medium confidence (60-80%): Multi-word tech+verb combinations

Categories:
1. Development Compounds: software development, engineering practices
2. Data Compounds: data processing, big data, ETL
3. Infrastructure Compounds: cloud services, deployment, orchestration
4. Architecture Compounds: system-level, integration, design patterns
