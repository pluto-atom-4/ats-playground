"""Phase 3: Integration with Preprocessor for Issue #191.

Tests that verify technical compound reclassification is working correctly
when integrated into the preprocessor's extract_entities() method.

Phase 3 focuses on:
1. End-to-end integration: text → preprocessor → skills/tech/requirements
2. Verification that compounds are moved from skills to technologies
3. Confirmation that soft skills are preserved
4. Confirmation that hard technologies are unaffected
