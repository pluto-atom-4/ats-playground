"""Phase 4: Validation & Metrics for Issue #191 - Technical Compound Reclassification.

Tests that validate the technical compound reclassification produces expected metrics:
- Skills/Technologies match rate improvement
- Edge case handling
- Confidence threshold validation
- Spot-check verification on representative jobs

Phase 4 Goals:
1. Verify compound detection accuracy (80%+ for exact matches)
2. Measure Skills match rate: 7.6% baseline → 15-20% target
3. Measure Technologies match rate: 69.3% baseline → 85-90% target
4. Validate edge cases (ambiguous, partial matches, etc.)
5. Ensure confidence thresholds work correctly
